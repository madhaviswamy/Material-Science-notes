Foams are commonly made by injecting a gas or mixing a foaming agent into molten metal. Melts can be foamed by creating gas bubbles in the material. Normally, bubbles in molten metal are highly buoyant in the high-density liquid and rise quickly to the surface.

Improvisations in foam quality of any type of foam concentrate on the foam physics, i.e., bubble formation, foam nucleation, growth, stability, development or gas diffusion in the liquid state

The mechanical properties of metal foams are correlated to the ones of the corresponding bulk metal wherein the dominant factors are the density and the structure itself. Mechanical properties depend mainly on the density, but are also influenced by the cell connectivity, cell roundness and diameter distribution, etc.

The most common failure mode of Metal foam is fatigue e.g., due to bending or torsion(compression or tension load)  Therefore, fatigue is mostly limited by the weakest property, namely by the tensile strength.

Mechanical properties: The damping capacity of metal foams is larger than that of solid metals by up to a factor of 10. Vibration control Foamed panels have higher natural flexural vibration frequencies than solid sheet of the same mass per unit area.

Thermal properties: Ability to absorb impact at constant load, coupled high-temperature with thermal stability above room capability temperature-High thermal conductivity. Open-cell foams have large accessible surface area heat exchangers/ and high cell-wall conduction giving exceptional refrigerators heat transfer ability
